The team begins the survey at one end of the selected reach. One team member (the \u201cstreambank person\u201d) begins walking along the bank (where possible), looking for any trash on the stream (or shore) bank, or above the high water line, and tallies any trash items found on the trash assessment sheet. The other person (the \u201cstreambed person\u201d) walks along the stream bed, or in the water at shorelines, and shouts out any trash items found in the water body for the person on land to tally on the trash assessment sheet. The person tallying the trash notes on the sheet whether the trash was found in the stream and below the high water line, or above the high water line (i.e., tally lines for below high water line (|), and tally dots or circles (\u2022) for above the high water line). This will help for assigning scores for the worksheet. A pole or similar lifting tool should be used to help look under bushes, logs, and other plant growth to see if trash has accumulated underneath. The ground or substrate should be carefully inspected to ensure that small items such as cigarette butts and pieces of broken glass or Styrofoam are being included. Because this is a rapid assessment, the tally is not exact, but it is important not to miss items that can affect human health, because such items can strongly affect the total score.",
